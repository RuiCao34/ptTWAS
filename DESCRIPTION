Description: Using single-cell gene expression, we model the gene expression as a function of pseudotime and incorporate it
	into conventional TWAS framework. Compared to bulk-tissue TWAS, pt-TWAS has higher resolution (i.e., cell-stage resolution)
	to identify disease genes. Its hypothesis test is powerful at examining the gene-disease association, while 
	its confidence band inference can pinpoint the cell stage of association, that is, at which cell stage the gene expression
	is associated with disease.
